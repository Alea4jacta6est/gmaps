Contributing
============

Contributions are very much encouraged. Jupyter-gmaps deserves more time than I
can give it, so there is scope for making significant contributions to the
project.

How to contribute
-----------------

The `documentation <http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/dev/gitwash/index.html>`_ for Numpy gives a detailed description of how to contribute to Numpy. Most of this information applies to development for ``gmaps``.


Testing
-------

We use nose for unit testing. Run ``nosetests`` in the root directory of the project to run all the tests,
or in a specific directory to just run the tests in that directory.

Guidelines
----------

Workflow
^^^^^^^^

We loosely follow the `git workflow <http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/dev/gitwash/development_workflow.html>`_ used in numpy development.  Features should
be developed in separate branches and merged into the master branch when
complete.

Code
^^^^

Please follow the `PEP8 conventions <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`_ for formatting and indenting code and for variable names.
